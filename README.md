# Getting Started with Create React App
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:
### `npm i`
then
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\

`npx open cypress` will allow you to open and run the tests that are written for this project.

# Overview
In this project, I wanted to deliver a quick and accurate way for Washington State based scuba divers and shell fish harvesters (and anyone else tide sensitive) to quickly see tides for their waterways and be able to save those tides for a quick view later. This app uses React, Router, Cypress, and PropTypes. It fetches data from the NOAA API. I wanted the app to be use-able by people who don't always use technology with ease.

## Wins
I wrote in depth Cypress tests stubbing things successfully, and stubbing some fetches that appeared out of nowhere.
My page is responsive across many sizes and I feel that most people could use my app with ease.

## Challenges
Error handling was a little confusing and I think I could refactor to handle it more efficiently.
